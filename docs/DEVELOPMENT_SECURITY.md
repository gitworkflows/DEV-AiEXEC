# Development Environment Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for developing Aiexec.

## Security Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to enforce security checks before code is committed:

- **Bandit**: Static code analysis for Python security issues
- **Safety**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secrets Detection**: Prevents committing sensitive information
- **Code Formatting**: Ensures consistent and secure code style

To install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### CI/CD Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following security checks:

1. **Bandit Security Scan**
   - Runs on every pull request
   - Scans Python code for common security issues
   - Configuration: `.bandit.yml`

2. **Dependency Security Check**
   - Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Fails the build on critical vulnerabilities
   - Uses Safety for Python dependencies

3. **Secret Scanning**
   - Prevents committing API keys and credentials
   - Scans for common secret patterns

## Secure Development Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

- Always use the latest authentication mechanisms
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management services

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit third-party code
- Prefer well-maintained packages
- Pin all dependencies to specific versions

## Security Testing

### Running Security Scans Locally

To run security scans locally:

```bash
# Run Bandit
uv run bandit -r . -c pyproject.toml

# Check dependencies with Safety
uv run safety check --full-report

# Run all pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. Do not create a public issue
2. Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature
3. Provide detailed steps to reproduce
4. Include potential impact and suggested fixes

## Secure Coding Guidelines

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs
- Use strong typing
- Sanitize all inputs
- Use allowlists instead of denylists

### Error Handling

- Never expose stack traces to users
- Log errors securely
- Use custom error pages
- Implement proper exception handling

### Session Management

- Use secure, HTTP-only cookies
- Implement proper session timeouts
- Regenerate session tokens after login
- Invalidate sessions on logout

## Dependency Management

### Adding New Dependencies

1. Check for known vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   uv run safety check
   ```
2. Review the package's security history
3. Prefer packages with active maintenance
4. Document the reason for adding the dependency

### Updating Dependencies

1. Check for updates:
   ```bash
   uv run pip list --outdated
   ```
2. Update dependencies one at a time
3. Test thoroughly after each update
4. Document any breaking changes

## Security Headers

Ensure the following security headers are set in production:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Incident Response

If you discover a security incident:

1. Do not disclose the issue publicly
2. Report it immediately to the security team
3. Document all actions taken
4. Follow the incident response plan

## Security Training

All developers should complete security training that covers:

- OWASP Top 10
- Secure coding practices
- Common vulnerabilities
- Security testing techniques

## Regular Security Audits

- Perform regular security audits
- Use automated scanning tools
- Conduct manual code reviews
- Document all findings and resolutions
