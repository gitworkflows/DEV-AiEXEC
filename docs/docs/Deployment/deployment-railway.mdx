This guide explains how to [deploy Aiexec on Railway](https://railway.com/?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=aiexec), a cloud infrastructure platform that provides auto-deploy, managed databases, and automatic scaling.

1. Create a Railway account.

   A Hobby account on Railway is sufficient for Aiexec's dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM requirements. For more information, see [Railway pricing](https://railway.com/pricing?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=aiexec).

2. Follow this link to deploy the Aiexec template on Railway:

3. Optional: Add any custom configuration for your Aiexec deployment.

   The Aiexec Railway template automatically sets up the infrastructure, deploys Aiexec, and then starts the application.

4. Wait for the deployment to complete.

5. Navigate to your Aiexec instance at your deployment's public URL, such as `https://APP-NAME.up.railway.app`.
