# Security Best Practices

This document provides guidelines and best practices for securing your Aiexec deployment and development environment. Following these recommendations will help protect your applications and data from potential security threats.

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Keys

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use environment variables or a secure secret management system
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions

```python
# Example of loading API keys from environment variables
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable not set")
```

### User Authentication

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for authentication when possible

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256)
- Use TLS 1.2+ for all network communications
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit
- Store encryption keys securely using a key management system

### Data Storage

- Store sensitive data only when absolutely necessary
- Implement data retention policies
- Regularly audit stored data and remove unnecessary information
- Use secure storage solutions with built-in encryption

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

- Restrict inbound and outbound traffic using firewall rules
- Only open necessary ports
- Implement network segmentation for production environments
- Use private networks for internal communications

### API Security

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Use API gateways for additional security layers
- Regularly audit API endpoints for vulnerabilities

## Dependency Management

### Version Pinning

All dependencies should have explicit version bounds to prevent unexpected updates:

```toml
# Good: Explicit version bounds
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.32.0,<3.0.0",
    "fastapi>=0.109.0,<0.110.0"
]
```

### Security Scanning

- Use `safety` to scan for known vulnerabilities
- Run `bandit` for static code analysis
- Integrate security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline
- Regularly update dependencies to address security issues

## Secure Development

### Code Review

- Require code reviews for all changes
- Use static analysis tools to identify security issues
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Document security-related decisions

### Testing

- Include security testing in your test suite
- Perform regular penetration testing
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Use dependency checking tools

## Monitoring & Logging

### Log Management

- Log security-relevant events
- Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information
- Centralize log collection and analysis
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities

### Monitoring

- Monitor system and application metrics
- Set up alerts for security incidents
- Track failed login attempts
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- Maintain an incident response plan
- Designate a security response team
- Document contact information for key personnel
- Conduct regular security drills

### Response

- Contain the incident to prevent further damage
- Investigate the root cause
- Notify affected parties if necessary
- Document lessons learned and update procedures

## Compliance

### Regulations

- Be aware of relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Implement necessary controls for compliance
- Document compliance efforts
- Conduct regular compliance audits

### Security Audits

- Perform regular security audits
- Address all findings promptly
- Document remediation efforts
- Consider third-party security assessments

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Aiexec, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email our security team at [security@aiexec.org](mailto:security@aiexec.org)
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your report and provide updates on our progress
