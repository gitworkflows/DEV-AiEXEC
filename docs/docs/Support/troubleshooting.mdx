This page provides troubleshooting advice for issues you might encounter when using Aiexec or contributing to Aiexec.

## Missing components

As Aiexec development continues, components are often recategorized or deprecated for better alignment or to prepare for new components.

If a component appears to be missing from the expected location on the **Components** menu, try the following:

* Search for the component or check other component categories, including [bundles](/components-bundle-components).
* [Expose legacy components](/concepts-components#component-menus), which are hidden by default.
* Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/aiexec-ai/aiexec/releases/latest) for component changes in recent releases.
* Make sure the component isn't already present in your flow if it is a single-use component.

If you still cannot locate the component, see [Aiexec GitHub Issues and Discussions](/contributing-github-issues).

## No input in the Playground

If there is no message input field in the **Playground**, make sure your flow has a [**Chat Input** component](/components-io#chat-io) that is connected, directly or indirectly, to the **Input** port of a **Language Model** or **Agent** component.

Because the **Playground** is designed for flows that use an LLM in a query-and-response format, such as chatbots and agents, a flow must have **Chat Input**, **Language Model**/**Agent**, and **Chat Output** components to be fully supported by the **Playground** chat interface.

For more information, see [Test flows in the Playground](/concepts-playground).

## Missing key, no key found, or invalid API key

If you get an API key error when running a flow, try the following:

* For all components that require credentials, make sure those components have a valid credential in the component's settings, such as the **API Key** field.
* If you store your credentials in [Aiexec global variables](/configuration-global-variables), make sure you selected the correct global variable and that the variable contains a valid credential.
* Make sure the provided credentials are active, have the required permissions, and, if applicable, have sufficient funds in the account to execute the required action. For example, model providers require credits to use their LLMs.

## Aiexec installation issues

The following issues can occur when installing Aiexec.

### Aiexec installation freezes at pip dependency resolution

Installing Aiexec OSS with `pip install aiexec` slowly fails with this error message:

```text
pip is looking at multiple versions of <<library>> to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
```

To work around this issue, install Aiexec with `uv` instead of `pip`, as explained in [Install and run the Aiexec OSS Python package](/get-started-installation#install-and-run-the-aiexec-oss-python-package).

### Linux installation fails to build required package

When you try to install Aiexec OSS on Linux, installation fails because of outdated or missing packages:

```bash
Resolved 455 packages in 18.92s
  × Failed to build `webrtcvad==2.0.10`
  ├─▶ The build backend returned an error
  ╰─▶ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)
```

To resolve this error, install the required build dependencies, and then retry the Aiexec installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
```

If upgrading your packages doesn't fix the issue, install `gcc` separately, and then retry the Aiexec installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

### Installation failure from `webrtcvad` package

If you experience an error from the `webrtcvad` package, run `uv pip install webrtcvad-wheels` in your virtual environment, and then retry the Aiexec installation.

### C++ build tools required for Aiexec Desktop on Windows

Microsoft Windows installations of Aiexec Desktop require a C++ compiler that may not be present on your system. If you receive a `C++ Build Tools Required!` error, follow the on-screen prompt to install Microsoft C++ Build Tools, or [install Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Aiexec startup issues

The following issues can occur when attempting to start Aiexec.

### No `aiexec.__main__` module

When you try to run Aiexec with the command `aiexec run`, you encounter the following error:

```bash
> No module named 'aiexec.__main__'
```

To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Run `uv run aiexec run` instead of `aiexec run`.
2. If that doesn't work, reinstall the latest Aiexec version with `uv pip install aiexec -U`.
3. If that doesn't work, reinstall Aiexec and its dependencies with `uv pip install aiexec --pre -U --force-reinstall`.

### Aiexec runTraceback

When you try to run Aiexec using the command `aiexec run`, you encounter the following error:

```bash
> aiexec runTraceback (most recent call last): File ".../aiexec", line 5, in <module>  from aiexec.__main__ import mainModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiexec.__main__'
```

There are two possible reasons for this error:

* **Multiple Aiexec installations**: You installed Aiexec using `pip install aiexec` but you already had a previous version of Aiexec installed in your system. In this case, you might be running the wrong executable.

    To solve this issue, run the correct executable by running `python -m aiexec run` instead of `aiexec run`.

    If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Aiexec with `uv pip install aiexec --pre -U`.

* **Version conflict during installation**: Some version conflicts might have occurred during the installation process. To resolve this issue, reinstall Aiexec and its dependencies by running `python -m pip install aiexec --pre -U --force-reinstall`.

### Environment variables not available from terminal

Environment variables set in your terminal aren't automatically available to GUI-based applications like Aiexec Desktop when launched through the Finder or the Start Menu.
To set environment variables for Aiexec Desktop, see [Set environment variables for Aiexec Desktop](/environment-variables#set-environment-variables-for-aiexec-desktop).

### Package is not installed

In Aiexec OSS, you can follow the error message's instructions to install the missing dependency.

To manage dependencies in Aiexec Desktop, see [Install custom dependencies in Aiexec Desktop](/install-custom-dependencies#aiexec-desktop).

## Aiexec upgrade issues

The following issues can occur when upgrading your Aiexec version.

For information about managing Aiexec versions, see [Install Aiexec](/get-started-installation).

### Something went wrong running migrations

The following error can occur during Aiexec upgrades when the new version can't override `aiexec-pre.db` in the Aiexec cache folder:

```bash
> Something went wrong running migrations. Please, run 'aiexec migration --fix'
```

To resolve this error, clear the cache by deleting the contents of your Aiexec cache folder.
The filepath depends on your operating system, installation type, and configuration options.
For more information and default filepaths, see [Memory management options](/memory#flow-storage-and-logs).

:::important
Clearing the cache erases your settings.
If you want to retain your settings files, create a backup of those files before clearing the cache folder.
:::

## Aiexec uninstall issues

The following issues can occur when uninstalling Aiexec.

### Dot directory isn't deleted when uninstalling Aiexec Desktop on macOS

On macOS, uninstalling Aiexec Desktop deletes the `.app` file but doesn't delete files in `~/.aiexec`, which includes files generated during usage like cache and settings.

If you reinstall Aiexec Desktop, it starts with the existing data from the previous installation.

To fully remove a Aiexec Desktop macOS installation, you must also delete `~/.aiexec`:

    ```bash
    rm -rf .aiexec
    ```

## Custom components and integrations issues

For troubleshooting advice for a third-party integration, see the information about that integration in the Aiexec documentation and the provider's documentation.

If you are building a custom component, see [Error handling and logging for custom Python components](/components-custom-components#error-handling-and-logging).
