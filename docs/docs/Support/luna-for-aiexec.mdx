With **Luna for Aiexec** support, you can develop and deploy Aiexec applications with confidence.

Luna is a subscription to the Aiexec expertise at DataStax. It's meant for Aiexec users who want all the benefits of running their own open-source deployments, as well as the peace of mind that comes with having direct access to the team that has authored the majority of the Aiexec code.

Luna subscribers can get help with general-purpose and technical questions for their open-source Aiexec deployments.
If an issue is encountered, DataStax is there to help.
