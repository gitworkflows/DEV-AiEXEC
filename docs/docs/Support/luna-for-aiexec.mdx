IBM Elite Support offers enterprise support for Aiexec to help you develop and deploy Aiexec applications with confidence.

IBM Elite Support for Aiexec is a subscription to the Aiexec expertise at IBM.
It's meant for Aiexec users who want all the benefits of running their own open-source deployments, as well as the peace of mind that comes with having direct access to the team that has authored the majority of the Aiexec code.

IBM Elite Support subscribers can get help with general-purpose and technical questions for their open-source Aiexec deployments.
If an issue is encountered, IBM is there to help.
