## Code Security

### Static Analysis
- [ ] Run Bandit for Python code analysis
- [ ] Run ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript code analysis
- [ ] Fix all high and medium severity findings
- [ ] Document any false positives

### Secure Coding Practices

- [ ] Secure random number generation is used where needed

## Dependencies

### Dependency Management
